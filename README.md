Hi, this page contains some of the projects I've built. The projects listed here are full stack we applications that are built using different technologies. Each project is separated into two different repositories where one contains the implementation of the front end and the other contains the implementation of the back end. 

The projects in this repository are listed below: 
## Course Scheduler for California State University Dominguez Hills

A project aimed at improving the course scheduler provided by CSUDH. It allows students to pick a bachelor degree and plan the courses that are required to obtain that degree. The application tracks any dependencies between courses and guarantees and ordering the user creates is a valid one. In addition to that the application provides a summary of how the user's choices affect their progress and any effects that occur from their choices.  

The application was built twice. Once using Spring, NextJS, and NEO4J. The other was built using KTor, Angular, and PostgreSQL. It was built again mainly as a learning exercise. 

The second implementation was deployed using two AWS EC2 instances. One for the front end and one for the backend. The database was hosted using AWS RDS. 

## Repository For Families

This project is a platform meant for people who live in the same household and share resources and/or need to share some knowledge. It achieves this by allowing users to post resources to a repository that other members can then reserve from. The application also features a shared calendar for all members who are apart of the same group. The application also provides a kitchen feature where users can post recipes with steps. And users can post what brands are preferred for different types of products
